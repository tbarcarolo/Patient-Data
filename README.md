# Patient Data Management System

In this assignment, the goal was to develop a patient data management system to handle and analyze patient information efficiently. The project is structured into two main parts:

1. **Data Handling and Analysis**: This part focuses on data manipulation, including calculating average patient age, managing medications, and determining time differences between appointments.
   
2. **User Interface for Doctors**: This part is about creating a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that allows doctors to access patient details easily and securely.
